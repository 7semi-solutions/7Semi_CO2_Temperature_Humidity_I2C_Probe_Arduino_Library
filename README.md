# 7Semi_CO2_Temperature_Humidity_I2C_Probe_Arduino_Library
This Arduino library provides support for the **7Semi CO₂, Temperature &amp; Humidity I2C Sensor Probe** — a reliable, compact, and low-power environmental sensor for embedded and IoT systems. It communicates over I²C and outputs real-time measurements of carbon dioxide (CO₂ in ppm), temperature (°C), and relative humidity (%RH).
